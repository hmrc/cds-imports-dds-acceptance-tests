  # will use to filter out the alerts that are shown to you. Note that while Zap is doing

  # from logging in, therefore we recommend that you set this to be urls for the

  # If, when you run the Zap tests, you find alerts that you have investigated and don't see as a problem
  # you can filter them out by adding to this list, using the cweid and the url regex that the alert was found on.
  # The CWE ID is a Common Weakness Enumeration (http://cwe.mitre.org/data/index.html), you can
  # find this by looking at the alert output from your tests.
  # example: alertsToIgnore = [{cweid: "16", url: "http://localhost:9999/hello/\\w{3}/here"},
  # {cweid: "17", url: "http://localhost:9999/hello/\\w{3}/here"}]
